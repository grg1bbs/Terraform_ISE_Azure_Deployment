# Terraform_ISE_Azure_Deployment
Terraform code for creating a lab environment in Azure using Cisco ISE 3.2 and the necessary Azure environment constructs (Resource Group, Virtual Network, Subnets, Security Group, Route Tables, etc) 

I built this code so that I could quickly spin up ISE nodes in Azure (they still take ~30min to complete building), test what I need, and tear the lab environment down when I am finished.
The code for the ISE resources can be scaled up/down as needed and used for either non-production or production environments.

This code was validated using:
 - ISE 3.2 AMI (ap-southeast-2 region) from the Azure Marketplace
 - Terraform version 1.3.5
 - Terraform azurerm provider version 3.0.2
 - (Site-to-Site VPN) Cisco ASA 5506-X (Security Plus license) running software version 9.16(3)23
 
 The following resources are created by this Terraform code:
  - TBD

#### Note: This code only deploys the individual standalone ISE nodes. It does not perform any operations to build the ISE cluster.
  
## Pre-requisites
   - Terraform application installed
   - Necessary Azure credentials and roles
   - Local RSA public/private keypair used to SSH into the ISE nodes
      - Code uses a public key located in home directory "~/.ssh/ise_azure_sshkey.pub" (configurable in the code)

See the following guide for how to get started using Terraform and Azure:

## Topology Diagram
The following diagram represents the basic topology built by this code. The on-prem 'Home Lab Network' is shown for reference only. No on-prem resources are created by this code.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grg1bbs/Terraform_ISE_Azure_Deployment
    ```

2. Edit the 'variables.tf' file to suit your environment (Vnet, Resource Group, Subnets, Availability Zones, VM size, ISE node IP addresses, etc.)

3. Update the user data text file (ise32az1.txt) to replace the \<variables\> to suit your environment. If preferred, change the hostname to suit your naming convention.

    See [Deploy Cisco Identity Services Engine Natively on Cloud Platforms](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/ISE_on_Cloud/b_ISEonCloud/m_ISEaaS.html) for guidance.

4. If needed, update the 'security-group.tf' file to provide greater restrictions for the Security Group

5. *Optional* - The code includes optional files and variables for building a site-to-site VPN tunnel with an on-prem VPN headend. This was validated using an on-prem Cisco ASA.

    If you want to create these site-to-site VPN resources, perform the following:
     - Un-comment the code in the 'vpn-gateway.tf' file (by removing the '/\*' and '\*/' characters)
     - Un-comment the code in the 'variables.tf' and update the variables with your tunnel pre-shared keys and vpn headend IP
     - Un-comment the code in the 'outputs.tf' file; this will inform terraform to print out the VPN tunnel IP addresses generated by Azure after they are created (the VPN Gateway resource can take up to 30 minutes to complete)
    
    Example ASA configuration can be found in the 'asa_vpn.txt' file in this repository

6. Initialise, Plan, and Apply the terraform run

    ```bash
    terraform init
    
    terraform plan
    
    terraform apply
    ```
